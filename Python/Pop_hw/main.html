          <p>As seen in the chart, the population of Manhattan reached its peak in 1910, following a period of steady growth from 1790. Since 1910, Manhattan's population has been in overall decline. The population declined slightly from 1910 until 1920, and then dropped sharply from then until 1930. Then from 1930 to 1950 there was slight growth in the population, followed by a sharp decline until 1980. From 1980 to 2010, the population has grown, but has never reached its peak in 1910. However, overall there has been growth in Manhattan's population between 1790 and 2010.</p>

          <p>The trends seen in Manhattan's growth are similar to the one's of the other 4 boroughs, with the exception of Staten Island, who's population as been growing steadily, but is significantly lower than the rest of the boroughs. Manhattan's, Queens's, Bronx's, Brooklyn's populations reach a peak in the early-mid 1900s, with Brooklyn's and Manhattan's being slightly earlier, and the Bronx's and Queen's being later, then decline until 1980 and then rise steadily until 2010. This delay in the year boroughs reach their peaks is likely explained by that as Manhattan's population declined, people began to move into the other 4 boroughs allowing them all to reach their population peaks slightly later. The decline in population overall in the 1930-1950 could possibly be due to WWII or the Great Depression. Interestingly, initially Manhattan's population was the highest, until it began to decline following its peak, and now both Queens and Brooklyn have higher populations.  </p>
