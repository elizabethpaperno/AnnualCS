        <b>Questions:</b> I wanted to find the correlation between the New COVID cases per day and the new daily vaccinations in the US, and to see if the numbers support the effecacy of the vaccines to curb the spread of COVID. I also wanted to see the trends with regards to how many people have been vaccinated.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Findings:</b> I found that since vaccine distribution began in January 2021 (around where new COVID cases reached their peakâ€“hitting 312,247 new cases on 01-10-2021), the number of new COVID case per day has been in consistent decline. This decline correlates quite closely with the increase in daily Covid vaccinations. Daily vaccinations constitently increased until about mid-April, and have been in decline since. This makes sense because as the number of unvaccinated people declines there is less opportunity to give more people vaccines. I suspect that the number of new vaccinations per day will continue to decline, as the percentage of the unvaccinated population that is vaccine hesitant increases as more people get their shots.
