    <center><h1>COVID and Vaccine as US (only) Search Trends vs. General Searches</h1></center>

        <b>Questions:</b> I studied Google Trends data on various popular topics like music, sports, and weather, and compared this to searches on COVID-related topics like Coronavirus, and vaccine. There were 2 key questions I was looking to address: (i) What similaries are there between COVID and Vaccination related searches and real life data? (ii) How the searches for various popular topics changed over the course of the pandemic?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Findings:</b> Interestingly, I found that the first peak for searches related to COVID occured in approximately February 2020 (as seen in Figure 4), which was prior to COVID becoming a major concern in the US (when it was spreading primarily abroad) but closely tied to the beginning of the market sell off (see <a href="stocks.html">Stock Indexes)</a>, likely because this panic led to people selling their shares, due to the unpredictable effects of the virus on the economy. It is evident, and unsurprising, that the search interest for COVID reached its ultimate peak in mid-March/April, when COVID cases began to climb in the US. I was also surprised that the other search categories did not change significantly throughout the Quarentine period. For instance, I suspected that searches related to weather would decline (as people stayed inside), and searches related to quarantine friendly past-times (like Sports, and Music) would increase. However, these broad topics have remained fairly consisent over the course of the data I evaluated. Additionally, searches related to vaccines rose in search interest as vaccines were first approved (see <a href="vaccinations.html">Vaccinations</a>). Interestingly there was a spike in weather related topics, closely correlated to a rise in searches for vaccinations. I suspect as people began to get vaccinated, they took more interest in the weather conditions outside; as cases declined due to the vaccine so did the restricitons on certain activities.
