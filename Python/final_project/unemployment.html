        <b>Questions:</b> Here I wanted to see the impact of the outbreak of COVID on the daily lives of American citizens, and their finical situations so that I could compare to the performance of <a href="stocks.html">Stock Market Indexes</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Findings:</b> By graphing the monthly unemployment rate vs the daily new COVID cases, I was able to find that from the first of March (data collected pre-covid) to the first of April (directly following the COVID outbreak in US), the unemployment rate rose by <b>10.4%</b> (4.4% in January, and 14.8% in April). I suspect this sharp rise was due to the restrictions imposed by local governments, and the shuttering of small businesses, as large companies boomed (see <a href="stocks.html#Find">Findings in Stock Market</a>). This data reflects the <b>current</b> state of the economy much better than the stock market. As seen in the data, the unemployment rate has not yet recovered to pre-COVID levels, with a rate of 4.4% in March 2020 and 5.8% in May 2021 (June has not been released). Interestingly, I found that the April 2020 unemployment rate was the <b>highest</b> reported level in FRED's database (data is available since <b>1948</b>).
